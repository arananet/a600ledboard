# a600ledboard

Just a recreated version of the A600 Led Board with smd components.

This tiny board allow to add or replace the indicator leds from the A600 in case of missing or broken board. I've made this because the board on my A600 was broken and with one cabled cutted.

I've redesigned it to use smd componentes. Also the connector is arranged in line to fit better on the A600 KB hole.

# Note

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
